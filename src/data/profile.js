  bio: "Hi, I'm Sukanya! I'm a Physical Chemistry Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where my research focuses on interfacial electron-transfer processes in plasmonic and electrochemical systems. I investigate how material structure, interfaces, and operating conditions govern performance \u2014 designing experiments that isolate those factors and translate them into reproducible, quantitative outcomes. I build custom electrochemical setups, develop MATLAB/Python workflows for data analysis, and use scanning electron microscopy to correlate structure with function.",
