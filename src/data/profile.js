  bio: 'I am completing my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, where my research focuses on interfacial electron-transfer processes in plasmonic and electrochemical systems. My work investigates how material structure, interfaces, and operating conditions govern performance — and I design experiments that isolate those factors and translate them into reproducible, quantitative outcomes. I build custom electrochemical setups, develop MATLAB/Python workflows for data analysis, and use scanning electron microscopy to correlate structure with function.',
